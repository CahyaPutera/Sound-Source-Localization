# Sound Source Localization - Demonstration

## Project Definition
Build MLP and CNN network for Sound Source Localization.

## Project Details
Input: binaural audio files

Output: labels

Classify 3 azimuth angles using binaural audio files as inputs. The azimuth angles are: 0, 30, and 60 degrees

Use MFCC as input features

Metrics: classification accuracy
